## ADMISSIONS ARE NOW OPEN FOR JULY 2017 


#### Institute Vision

Nayantara runs regular classes in pure classical Kathak at her studio in Viman Nagar, Pune. Having a strong technical foundation and a deep passion for teaching with over 12 years of experience, Nayantara has always strived to carry forward the tradition of Indian classical dance in its purest form, with immense discipline, yet with innovative methods to engage the new generation.

The aim of the institute is not only to impart training in the practical aspects of Kathak, but also to ensure that each student has a thorough knowledge of the theory behind everything they learn. In addition to this, Nayantara also stresses on the importance of yoga and Hindustani classical music from the very beginning. 

Hugely inspired by the teachings of senior gurus and artists, Nayantara also believes that as part of dance training, young practitioners should also be exposed to allied forms of art and well-being, such as painting, sculpture, photography, architecture, poetry, literature, fitness and nutrition, and hopes to invite professionals in those fields to conduct interactive workshops from time to time, thus providing a truly holistic arts education, the first of its kind in Pune.

Nayantara also trains her students for annual showcases, competitions and stage performances for cultural events.


#### Batches 

There are separate batches for children and adults. 

Children's classes will be held twice a week on weekday evenings. Girls and boys aged 6 and above are eligible for this batch. 

The adults' batches will be held on the weekend. Women and men of all ages are eligible to join these batches. No prior training in dance is required to join the beginners batch. Those with a minimum of 2 years of training are eligible for the intermediate batch. Those with at least 8 years of training in Kathak may join the advanced batch after an initial screening test.
